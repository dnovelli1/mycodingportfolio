                    Hello, my name is Jake Novelli and I am 27 years old from Vacaville, CA.
                    I have a bachelors of science (Cum Laude) in Kinesiology and am currently engulfed in the Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkley. 
                    Web development has always been a dream of mine. 
                    I finally made the decision to pursue the field I love the most. Web Development!
                    I am able to exceed all of your wants and needs in Web Development. 
                    I will take things to the next level to ensure that my clients always have the step ahead from the competition. 
                    I encourage you to have a sneak peek into my work section to see what you could have on your side!
                    I greatly appreciate you stopping by, please contact me for any further information or inquiries!
